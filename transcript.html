    <h1>Hi, my name is Ibing Maharlika.</h1>
    <p>This is the website that I built for COMP 2861 Assignment 2 titled "Layout Design for a Website".</p>

    <h2>Design Concept</h2>
    <p>
        This website demonstrates CSS floats in web design. While the header image is static, the other elements use floats.
		  The navigation bar items are floated to the left with centered text. In the main body, I created two columns: an image
		  on the left and text on the right, both displayed side by side using the float property. In the footer, I applied floats
		  for various elements like a navigation button, social media icons, contact info, and a copyright statement. Floats are mixed 
		  to achieve the design: the copyright is floated left, while the navigation is floated right.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        Since this was my first HTML and CSS project, the design process took some time. I explored inspiration from sites like Pinterest, 
		  land-book.com, Dribbble.com and many others, before sketching in Figma. I initially used a stock image but eventually chose
		  a self-portrait from my photo album. The image fits the personal website theme, and I added a box-shadow effect for a floating appearance.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Color Scheme & Typography</h2>
    <p>
        The color palette was based on the image, featuring dark and light contrasting tones for balance. After experimenting with combinations, 
		  I settled on a harmonious scheme. For typography, I used the Roboto font from Google Fonts, known for its friendly, open curves, ideal for
		  a relaxed reading experience.
    </p>
    
	 <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
        I implemented progressive enhancement with text sizing that adjusts with window resizing. However, the image shrinks more than the text when 
		  the window is small, creating imbalance. Solving this issue with floats proved difficult, and online research suggested Flexbox, which I plan 
		  to learn later.
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        The horizontal navigation bar contains four active links: the first links to this page, the second to another page, the third to a how-to page,
		  and the fourth to a transcript. The footer also includes a button linking to another page, as required by the assignment.
    </p>

    <h2>Another Page</h2>
    <p>
        On the next page, I detailed the design process for the 'About Me' section, using a CSS grid layout. The grid system organizes images and content 
		  into rows and columns. The navigation bar at the top still uses floats, but the rest of the page relies on the grid for placement. A personal photo
		  of the St. Lawrence River serves as the background, edited in Figma and tiled for use.
    
    <h2>Upload and Test</h2>
    <p>
        I included steps for uploading and testing the website, linking them to a navigation bar item. Although I havenâ€™t tested these steps myself, 
		  I referenced online sources to compile them.
    </p>	 

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        I found the grid system easier to work with than floats since it offers more control over element placement. However, it requires more complex HTML.
		  Despite the challenges, this project was a valuable learning experience. While I did more than required, it helped me understand how HTML and CSS
		  function together.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you very much.</p>
