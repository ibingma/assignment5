    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Hi, my name is Ibing Maharlika</h2>
        <p>This web form is integrated into the personal webpage from the previous assignment. 
		  Its purpose is to enable users to contact me, the website owner. Before submitting a 
		  message, users are required to provide their contact information to ensure that I can 
		  respond.</p>
        
        <h3>Design Concept</h3>
        <p>The design of this form aligns with the theme of the main page, maintaining a
		  consistent color scheme, similar settings, a heading image, navigation bar, and footer.
		  This cohesive design reassures users that they are still on the same website. 
		  No additional images or distracting elements were introduced here, allowing users to
		  focus solely on completing this form. Aside from the required fields, this page design
		  is intentionally minimalistic to enhance usability.</p>

        <h3>Form’s Fields</h3>
        <p>Certain fields, such as first name, last name, and email address, are mandatory.
		  If these fields are left blank, an error message will prompt the user to complete them 
		  before submission. The city and province fields are pre-filled with common local options,
		  while the postal code and phone number fields must follow a specific format. 
		  The form includes a dropdown menu for selecting an occupation, a checkbox, 
		  and a fixed-size comment box. The comment box's dimensions were locked 
		  after observing that resizing it caused layout issues.</p>

        <p>The input fields change color when they receive focus, and required fields display 
		  tooltips prompting the user to complete them. Specific input formats, like postal codes,
		  must follow local conventions. Although the phone number field uses the 'tel' input type,
		  it can still accept non-numeric characters.</p>

        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        <p>This form includes two buttons: one to clear the form and another to submit it. 
		  If required fields are left incomplete, clicking the submit button triggers a warning, 
		  highlighting the fields that need attention. This submit button is scripted to verify 
		  that all necessary data is complete and valid before allowing submission.
		  This script is taken from one of the tutorials provided on this subject.</p>

        <h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
        <p>This page utilizes the Flexbox layout system, making it easier to implement than 
		  float or CSS grid systems. Flexbox also enhances responsiveness. As the screen size 
		  decreases, the form transitions into a stacked layout without requiring media queries.</p>

        <p>I’ve also updated the main page, which previously used a floating layout.
		  It now leverages the Flexbox system, making it easier to manage the display of items.
		  The content is arranged in a flex-row layout, and when the screen width is below 640 
		  pixels, the image is hidden, and text size is increased for readability. At smaller
		  screen sizes, the navigation bar is replaced with an icon that displays the menu when
		  hovered over, allowing users to see only essential content.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The implementation of the Flexbox system has significantly enhanced the form's 
		  structure and responsiveness, creating a more user-friendly experience.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
