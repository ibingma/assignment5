    <h1>Hi, my name is Ibing Maharlika</h1>
    <h2>Assignment 4: Making a Website Portable and Using Multimedia</h2>

    <p>
        The "Celebrate Birthday" webpage theme is designed to be lively and festive, incorporating a wide array of concepts 
		  I've learned throughout my course. At the heart of the design is an image of Tokyo’s vibrant night scene, which sets
		  an energetic backdrop for the page. Positioned at the edge of this image is a navigation bar enhanced with a hover 
		  effect that increases the background color’s opacity, adding an interactive element. This section allowed me to apply 
		  both absolute and relative positioning, techniques I explored and practiced extensively.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Adding to the festive atmosphere, a countdown timer is set—not for a specific birthday but rather for New Year's Day 2025,
		  building anticipation and aligning with the celebratory tone of the page. Between the navigation bar and the footer, 
		  a silhouette of people dancing serves as a dynamic background image, bridging the sections and further enhancing the lively feel.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Incorporating multimedia elements, I included both audio and video sections. The audio plays a jazz-style birthday song, 
		  adding a playful soundtrack, while the video, taken during Canada National Day celebrations in Whitby, combines visuals 
		  of celebration with a birthday song overlay, tying it back to the theme. To encourage interaction, I also created a scrolling 
		  column where comments from others are displayed, moving continuously upward to simulate live engagement. It pauses when 
		  the mouse pointer hovers over it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The page is responsive as well. Media queries are used to adapt to various widths, including mobile screen width. 
		  Throughout the page, I relied heavily on Flexbox to arrange and group content effectively, which was an excellent exercise 
		  in organizing layout and mastering container grouping. Although the design may appear crowded, it represents a blend of practical 
		  application and experimentation with different course concepts, creating a rich, celebratory environment that reflects both
		  the theme and my learning journey.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2: New Web Form Styling</h2>

    <p>
        For this form, I organized the elements into three groups, each displayed in a row layout using Flexbox. 
		  While the components remain the same as in the previous assignment, I applied a new layout for improved structure. 
		  Additionally, I incorporated a scenic background image to enhance the form's visual appeal.
    </p>

    <p>
        To add interactive elements, I included a subtle transition effect on the form title, creating a smooth animation.
		  The submit button also features a similar transition effect to provide a cohesive experience. The form is designed 
		  with progressive enhancement in mind, gracefully adapting to smaller screen sizes and stacking the elements vertically
		  for an optimized mobile view.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for watching.</p>
