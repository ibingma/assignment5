    <h1>Hi, my name is Ibing Maharlika</h1>
    <h2>Assignment 5: Demonstrate Use of JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
        The first task was to change the background color of the homepage at regular intervals. These color changes are 
		  applied to both the HTML and body elements' backgrounds. The intervals are set at 5 seconds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Adding to the festive atmosphere, a countdown timer is set—not for a specific birthday but rather for New Year's Day 2025,
		  building anticipation and aligning with the celebratory tone of the page. Between the navigation bar and the footer, 
		  a silhouette of people dancing serves as a dynamic background image, bridging the sections and further enhancing the lively feel.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        These are the JavaScript codes, where I used a function called changeBackgroundColor to cycle through different colors. 
		  These colors, which are specific to the homepage, are stored in an array. Both the colors array and the colorIndex 
		  variables are defined outside the function so that they don’t have to be redefined with each interval. This is especially
		  important for colorIndex because it needs to increment and remember its position every time the function is called.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The colorIndex cycles through the array continuously without exceeding its bounds. This is achieved using the 
		  modulo operator (%), which resets colorIndex to the beginning of the array once it reaches the end, creating a smooth loop 
		  through the colors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Back to the homepage, I have added the current local time display at the top left. JavaScript function is used to
		  add this time and date elements into the html when the page is loaded onto the screen. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the function called addLocalTime to add the local time and date. 
    </p>
	 
	 <p>
        And this is the runClock function to set the time and date to the current setting. They are all displayed under the
		  div id dateNow.
    </p>
	 
	 <p>
        The homepage still works under different screen settings.
    </p>
	 <p>
        The second task was to add a new page to the website featuring a countdown timer to a specific date.
		  I designed the page with a clean, minimalist style to keep the timer as the focal point. For the backdrop, 
		  I chose a stunning sunset photo taken from one of Bali’s beautiful beaches, adding a serene and visually striking element. 
    </p>
	 <p>
        The navigation bar has been repositioned to sit at the bottom of the image, providing easy access without distracting 
		  from the main content.
    </p>
	 <p>
         Aside from the timer, there’s a single paragraph to keep the page simple and uncluttered.
    </p>
	 <p>
        JavaScript code powers the countdown timer functionality. The countdown function itself is adapted from a tutorial in
		  the textbook, with modifications for flexibility and style.
    </p>

    <p> I moved the targetDate variable outside the function for easy access, allowing quick adjustments to the countdown date. </p>
	 
	 <p>Additionally, I included if-else statements to change the color of the timer and text as the target date approaches, 
	 adding a visual cue as the event draws nearer.</p>
	 
	 <p>Let’s change the date to below 30 days. </p>
	 
	 <p>The texts and timer color changed to red.</p>
	 
	 <p>Let’s change the date again to above 30 days but below 180 days.</p>
	 
	 <p>The texts and timer color changed to green.</p>
	 
	 <p>And above 180 days, the texts and timer color changed to blue.</p>
	 
	 <p>The page also works for different screen sizes.</p>
	 
	 <p>Thank you for watching.</p>
